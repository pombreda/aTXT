Purpose
-------

Do you want a easy extraction tool to make your data mining analysis or
whatever?. Everybody knows to handle ``.txt`` is so easy to read and
usefull to processing.

I've used these scripts to convert common files documents to plain text with
just *doble-click*, as one way to use it, but you could use it in a
shell. The outcome by the way it's just a ``.txt`` file for each
document.
